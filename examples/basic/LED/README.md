## Blink LED

### Components
* 1x LED
* 1x Resistor 330 ohm for the LED
* 1x Resistor 10K for the ATmega328p
* 1x AVR microcontroller

*Note: This example assumes that the fuse bits are configured to use the internal oscillator. Refer to the cheat sheet for further details.*

*Note: The wires between the microcontrollers and the programmer are not shown in this circuit but they can optionally remain in the circuit even after programming the chip. Refer to the cheat sheet for further details about the wiring.*
