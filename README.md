### Eclipse
#### Installation
* Install Eclipse C/C++
* Install plugin:
  * From Eclipse, go to **Help** > **Eclipse Marketplace**
  * Search for and install **AVR Eclipse Plugin**

#### Create a new project
* Create a new C Project
  * Select **AVR Cross Target Application** > **Empty Project** as project type
  * Select **AVR-GCC Toolchain** in the Toolchains box
* Press **Finish**

#### Configure project
* In **Project Explorer** select the AVR project
* Go to **Project** > **Properties**
* Expand **C/C++ Build** then select **Settings**
  * Check the **Generate HEX file for Flash memory**
* Expand **AVR** then select **AVRDude**
  * From the **Programmer** tab
    * Create a new programmer configuration
    * Give this configuration a name (Sparkfun Pocket AVR Programmer, USBASP USBISP AVR Programmer, etc...)
    * From the **Programmer Hardware**:
      * Select **USBasp** if you have the "USBASP USBISP AVR Programmer"
      * Select **USBtiny** if you have the "SparkFun Pocket AVR Programmer"
      * If you have something else then select the corresponding value
      * The option selected will be the value for the `-c` flag in the `avrdude` command
  * From the **Flash/EEPROM** tab
    * Make sure **Upload Flash Memory Image** is **from build**
* From the expanded **AVR**, select **Target Hardware**
  * Select **ATmega328p** as **MCU type**. If you are programming another AVR micrcontroller, then select the corresponding one.
* Done! Click on **Apply and Close**

Note that we did not explicitly tell **avr-gcc** to include ATMega328p header files using the -I flag, nor to link the correct libraries using -l flag. However, we did mention in the configuration that the target hardware is an ATMega328p which will add the -mmcu=atmega328p to the avr-gcc command and use the corresponding files. 

For instance, consider some IO functionality is required in the C program written for the ATmega328p. To use those functionalities, the <avr/io.h> header file should be included. Using the -mmcu switch the compiler will directly know that the file meant to be loaded is in fact <avr/iom328p.h> by preprocessing the macros in <avr/io.h>. 

> #include <avr/io.h>  
> This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the device that has been specified by the -mmcu= compiler command-line switch. This is done by diverting to the appropriate file <avr/ioXXXX.h> which should never be included directly. Some register names common to all AVR devices are defined directly within <avr/common.h>, which is included in <avr/io.h>, but most of the details come from the respective include file.

```
avr-gcc -std=c11 -mmcu=atmega328 -O -o avr.o avr.c
```
  * Select the correct `-mmcu` switch value for your AVR microcontroller
* Generate hex file:
```
avr-objcopy -O ihex avr.o avr.hex
```
* Upload hex to the AVR microcontroller: 
```
avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U flash:w:avr.hex
```
  * Select the `-c` value depending on which AVR programmer device your are using.
    * Use `usbtiny` for the SparkFun Pocket AVR Programmer
    * Use `usbasp` for the USBASP USBISP AVR Programmer
    * Or if you have another AVR Programmer select the correct value
  * Select the `-p` value depending on which AVR microcontroller is used

Use <a href="script/ATmega328-upload.sh">ATmega328-upload.sh</a> script file to buid a C program and upload its hex to the ATmega328p (The script file uses the commands described above). 

#### Reset fuse bytes to default values manually
*Warning: In the following steps, the ATmega328p will be used as an example, but the ideas is the same for other AVR microcontrollers. Make sure you use your AVR datasheet and not another AVR datasheet because changing wrong fuse bits can possibly prevent you from reprogramming the AVR later*

* Open the ATmega328p [datasheet](#datasheet) ยง 31.2. Fuse Bits.
* Locate the **Fuse Low Byte** table
  * Start writing the **Default value** top-down (Bits#: 7...0)
  * ATmega328p default values result in the following binary: 01100010 (binary) = 0x62 (hex)
  * The low fuse byte switch is now ready: `-Ulfuse:w:0x62:m`
* Locate the **Fuse High Byte** table
  * Similarly, write the **Default value**
  * ATmega328p default values result in the following binary: 11011001 (binary) = 0xd9 (hex)
  * The high fuse byte switch is now ready: `-Uhfuse:w:0xd9:m`
* Locate the **Extended Fuse Byte for ATmega328/P** table
  * Write the **Default value**
  * ATmega328p default values result in the following binary: 11111111 (binary) = 0xff (hex)
  * The extended fuse byte switch is now ready: `-Uefuse:w:0xff:m`
* The final command looks like this:
```
avrdude -pm328p -cusbasp -Ulfuse:w:0x62:m -Uhfuse:w:0xd9:m -Uefuse:w:0xff:m 
```
  * Remeber to update the `-c` and `-p` switches to match your programmer and chip. (more details: [Build and upload manually](#build-and-upload-manually).

#### Read fuse bytes manually
* Reading fuse bits is done using `avrdude` command.
```
avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U lfuse:r:-:h -U hfuse:r:-:h -U efuse:r:-:h
```
  * Remeber to update the `-c` and `-p` switches to match your programmer and chip. (more details: [Build and upload manually](#build-and-upload-manually).
  * The `-` symbol in each of the `-U` switches values tells the command to print the results on the screen. To write the output on a file, just replace `-` by a file path (e.g. `/tmp/low_fuse.hex`). 

### Input/Output
#### Introduction
Each Input/Output pin on the AVR microcontroller belong to a Port alphabet (e.g. Pin 28 on the ATmega328p belongs to Port C). Each of those pins has three register bits assigned to them: DDxn in DDRx, PORTxn in PORTx and PINxn in PINx.

Source: [Datasheet](#datasheet) ยง 18.2.1. Configuring the Pin

DDRx, PORTx and PINx registers consist of one byte each, allowing at most 8 physical pins to be configured per alphabet letter. 

#### DDRx
```
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| DDx7 | DDx6 | DDx5 | DDx4 | DDx3 | DDx2 | DDx1 | DDx0 |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
```
Data Direction Register x allows specifying the direction of the I/O pins belonging to the Port x.  
If the bit 1 was written to DDx0, then Px0 direction is "output". If the bit 0 was written, then Px0 direction is "input".

#### PORTx
```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| PORTx7 | PORTx6 | PORTx5 | PORTx4 | PORTx3 | PORTx2 | PORTx1 | PORTx0 |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
```
Port x register has two functionalities depending on the Data Direction Register x bits values.  
If DDx0 is set to "input", then writing 1 at PORTx0 activates the pull-up resistor at Px0, and writing 0 deactivates it at Px0.  
If DDx0 is set to "output", then writing 1 at PORTx0 drives Px0 high, and writing 0 drives Px0 low. 

#### PINx
```
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| PINx7 | PINx6 | PINx5 | PINx4 | PINx3 | PINx2 | PINx1 | PINx0 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
```
Pin x register allows reading the values on the pins with "input" direction. For instance, if DDx0 is set to "input", then PINx0 can be used to read the input value.

### Fuse bits
#### Introduction
In an AVR, fuse bytes are composed of 8 fuse bits responsible for the behavior of the chip. The bits are programmable and nonvolatile (the fuse bits programmed dont change their values the next time the chip is active). Writing 1 into a fuse bit sets it to unprogrammed and 0 sets it to programmed.

Some AVR microcontrollers have 2 fuse bytes (low and high) and others like the ATmega328p have 3 fuse bytes (low, high and extended). The fuse bits position and default values can be different in different AVR microcontrollers, so refer to you AVR datasheet section "Fuse Bits" for the exact information (othewise, wrong values can possibly damage your chip. 

#### Low fuse byte
The low fuse byte enables controlling the speed, start up time and the source of the clock. Furthermore, it allows exposing the system clock output on a pin specified in your AVR datasheet.

#### High fuse byte
The high fuse byte is responsible for various type of configuration. The features explained in the following lines are extracted from the high fuse byte table shown in the ATmega328p [datasheet](#datasheet), and can be different from your AVR microcontroller, so always refer to your AVR datasheet.

* Enable/Disable AVR reset functionality. Disabling the AVR reset makes the chip non reprogrammable.
* Enable/Disable chip debug mode.
* Enable/Disable SPI communication
* Enable/Disable a watchdog timer which resets the chip if it was not responding.
* Enable/Disbale erasing EEPROM (a non-volatile memory) which can hold permanent data.
* Enable/Disable loading the bootloader
* Define the size of the bootloader

*Warning: Do not modify the reset, debug and SPI functionalities if you don't know how they work because this can prevent you from reprogramming the chip*

#### Extended fuse byte
If the ATmega chips is offered a poor voltage, it can become unstable and possibly misbehave. Therefore, the extended fuse byte allows setting a BOD (Brown-Out Detector) threshold voltage determining if the chip should stay active or should reset.

### Clock source
#### AVR Clock
*Note: If you have an AVR microcontroller other than the ATmega328p, then you can check the values below in your datasheet under the section "Calibrated Internal RC Oscillator".*

By default the ATmega328p internal RC Oscillator provides an 8.0Mhz clock. Also the default fuse bit CKDIV8 is programmed which divides the internal frequency by 8 (8.0Mhz / 8 = 1.0Mhz). To make the chip work on an 8Mhz frequency (maximum clock speed), the CKDIV8 bit must be unprogrammed. If more than 8Mhz is needed then avoid overclocking your AVR (can misbehave), instead use an external clock source. 

*Note: For more details about fuse bits CKDIV8 configuration, check the [Fuse bits](#fuse-bits) section.*

#### Why using external clock source
External clock source, such as an external crystal oscillator, is sometimes important because it provides a more accurate timing than the one offered by the internal RC oscillator integrated in the AVR. A more accurate clock is required when the program developed depends on a very accurate clock (e.g. Timer) or envolves USB related functionalities where timing is curicial. However, adding an external crystal oscillator consumes more power, resulting in quickly draining the batteries.

#### Example of clock source
Example for using internal and external clock source can be found in the section [Examples](#examples)

### External interrupts
#### Difference between INTx and PCINTx
* There are only few INTx pins but there are a lot more PCINTx pins.
* Each INTx pin have its own interrupt vector making it simple for the developer to listen for an event on that specific pin. On the other hand, a PCINTx pin shares an interrupt vector with several others, so listening for an event on that specific pin requires additional steps in order to mask out the other PCINTx pins in the same vector. To know which PCINTx pins share the same interrupt vector, refer to you AVR datashete at section "EXINT - External Interrupts".
* INTx can report events under several situations (For ATmega328p: INT0:[low, any] and INT1:[falling, rising]). PCINTx report events on any change.
  * Note that as of revision B of the ATmega328p datasheet, there is a typo in the Interrupt Sense Control 0 and 1 tables. The fix is: ISC00 and ISC01 are for INT0, and ISC10 and ISC11 are for INT1.

#### Configure INTx
* In general, the Data Direction value (DDxn) for INTx is set to "input", and the port value (PORTxn) is set to high (enable pull-up resitor). However, setting the Data Direction for INTx to "output" will still trigger an event.
* As explained above, the INTx can report event on different degrees. To specify this degree level, refer to the datasheet at section "External Interrupt Control Register A" in order to set the value for `EICRA`.
* The ATmega328p has two INTx pins (INT0 and INT1). To specify the used one(s), set the value for `EIMSK` by checking the options in the datasheet at section "External Interrupt Mask Register".
* To activate interrupts use `sei()` and to deactivate them use `cli()`.
* To handle events from INTx, use the following function `ISR(INTx_vect){...}`

#### Configure PCINTx
* In general, the Data Direction value (DDxn) for PCINTx is set to "input", and the port value (PORTxn) is set to high (enable pull-up resitor). However, setting the Data Direction for PCINTx to "output" will still trigger an event.
* Set the range of pins that will cause an interrupt. This can be done by setting the value for the `PCICR` to the corresponding range(s). Details about setting this register can be found in the datasheet at section "Pin Change Interrupt Control Register".
* In the selected ranges, mask out the pins that will not provide any interrupts by setting the value for `PCMSKx` where `x` is the group index for the selected pin range. If more than one range is selected, then multiple `PCMSKx` should be defined. For more information about the values for that register refer to the datasheet at section "Pin Change Mask Register ...".
* To activate interrupts use `sei()` and to deactivate them use `cli()`.
* To handle events from PCINTx, use the following function `ISR(PCINTy_vect){...}` where `y` is the group index of the selected range pins.

#### Example of external interrputs
Example for using external interrupts can be found in the section [Examples](#examples)
