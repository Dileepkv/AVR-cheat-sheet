### Datasheet
#### ATmega328p

### Eclipse
#### Installation
* Install Eclipse C/C++
* Install plugin:
  * From Eclipse, go to **Help** > **Eclipse Marketplace**
  * Search for and install **AVR Eclipse Plugin**

#### Create a new project
* Create a new C Project
  * Select **AVR Cross Target Application** > **Empty Project** as project type
  * Select **AVR-GCC Toolchain** in the Toolchains box
* Press **Finish**

#### Configure project
* In **Project Explorer** select the AVR project
* Go to **Project** > **Properties**
* Expand **C/C++ Build** then select **Settings**
  * Check the **Generate HEX file for Flash memory**
* Expand **AVR** then select **AVRDude**
  * From the **Programmer** tab
    * Create a new programmer configuration
    * Give this configuration a name (Sparkfun Pocket AVR Programmer, USBASP USBISP AVR Programmer, etc...)
    * From the **Programmer Hardware** select:
      * Select **USBasp** if you have the "USBASP USBISP AVR Programmer"
      * Select **USBtiny** if you have the "SparkFun Pocket AVR Programmer"
      * If you have something else then select the corresponding value
  * From the **Flash/EEPROM** tab
    * Make sure **Upload Flash Memory Image** is **from build**
* From the expanded **AVR**, select **Target Hardware**
  * Select **ATmega328p** as **MCU type**. If you are programming another AVR micrcontroller, then select the corresponding one.
* Done! Click on **Apply and Close**

Note that we did not explicitly tell **avr-gcc** to include ATMega328p header files using the -I flag, nor to link the correct libraries using -l flag. However, we did mention in the configuration that the target hardware is an ATMega328p which will add the -mmcu=atmega328p to the avr-gcc command and use the corresponding files. 

For instance, consider some IO functionality is required in the C program written for the ATmega328p. To use those functionalities, the <avr/io.h> header file should be included. Using the -mmcu switch the compiler will directly know that the file meant to be loaded is in fact <avr/iom328p.h> by preprocessing the macros in <avr/io.h>. 

> #include <avr/io.h>  
> This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the device that has been specified by the -mmcu= compiler command-line switch. This is done by diverting to the appropriate file <avr/ioXXXX.h> which should never be included directly. Some register names common to all AVR devices are defined directly within <avr/common.h>, which is included in <avr/io.h>, but most of the details come from the respective include file.

#### Compile and upload
* Write a small C program for the your AVR microntroller
* Build the project
* Do the required wiring between the AVR microcontroller and the programmer (check the prgorammer section for more details)
* Plug the programmer into your machine
* Go to **AVR** > **Upload Project to Target Device**
